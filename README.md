# java-workspace

Personal Java workspace with sample projects, utilities, and learning exercises.

## About

`java-workspace` is a personal collection of Java projects, small libraries, and experiments intended for learning, demos, and quick prototyping. It groups bite-sized examples and reusable utilities so you can explore language features, common patterns, and build tooling.

## Projects

This repository may include (example):

- `sample-app` — small console or web application demonstrating language features
- `utils` — utility libraries used across projects
- `examples` — short, focused example programs

Each project lives in its own directory and should include its own build configuration (Maven/Gradle) or simple `javac`/`java` invocation where applicable.

## Getting started

Prerequisites:

- Java 11+ (or the Java version required by individual projects)
- Maven or Gradle (if used by a project)

Quick start:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codebyankitsaraf/java-workspace.git
   cd java-workspace
   ```

2. Open a project in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) or build from the command line:

   - Maven: `mvn -f <project-dir> clean install`
   - Gradle: `./gradlew -p <project-dir> build`
   - Plain Java: `javac` / `java` commands in the specific directory
